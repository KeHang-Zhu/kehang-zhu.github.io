Hello there! I'm Kehang.

I'm a fourth year Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University. I've been jointly advised by [Prof. John Horton](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/john-j-horton) from [MIT Sloan's IT group](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/faculty-research-centers) and [Prof. David Parkes](https://parkes.seas.harvard.edu/) from Harvard's [EconCS group](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu/). 
I am currently supported by Google DeepMind Seed Fund.


## My Research
The central problem I aim to address is how to make **mechanism design** more applicable in real-world scenarios. Many theoretically optimal mechanisms are seldom applied in practice due to their complexity.

My work focuses on using Large Language Models (LLMs) as **Proxies** for Human behaviors in traditional lab experiments. People can express their intentions in natural language, and an LLM agent will act as their proxy within the mechanism.


<!-- I am generally interested in modelling human behaviors and mechanism design.

In the short term,, I am exploring these two directions:
1. Do Language Models (LMs) behave like Humans?
2. Are predictions made on LMs valid on Humans? 

Looking ahead, my long-term scope concerning two questions:
1. How to better model Human Behaviors with AI?
2. How to increase the Welfare of Human Being with AI modeling? -->

## My Journey So Far

Before joining Harvard, I was very lucky, undeservedly so, to be host by Nobel Laureate in Physics [Prof. Frank Wilczek](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/frank-wilczek/) in MIT. I was working on using Quantum field theory to model correlated dynamics inside a class of material (quantum spin ice) [News](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR22/Session/K51.5).

My research interests turned to human and society after an enriching collaboration with [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://seas.harvard.edu/person/hanspeter-pfister) from Harvard [Viusal Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/). I ran large-scale human-subject studies to investigate the mental models of people making sense of visualizations [CHI 24'](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2024/program/content/147374).

## A Pinch of Extra

When I'm not geeking out over research, you can find me capturing the world through my camera lens ðŸ“¸, embracing the beauty of nature ðŸŒ², hitting the ski slopes ðŸŽ¿, or trekking through scenic trails ðŸ¥¾.


## Selected Honors
- Introduction to Technical AI Safety Fellowship, 2024
- Purcell Fellowship (Harvard), 2021
- Guo Moruo Scholarship (Highest honor for USTC undergrad students), 2020
